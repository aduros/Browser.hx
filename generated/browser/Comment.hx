/** <p>A comment is used to add notations within markup; although it is generally not displayed, it is still available to be read in the source view (in Firefox:&nbsp;View -&gt; Page Source).&nbsp; These are represented in HTML and XML as content between <code>&lt;!--</code> and&nbsp; <code>--&gt; . </code>In XML, the character sequence "--" cannot be used within a comment.</p>
<p>A comment has no special properties or methods of its own, but inherits those of <a title="En/DOM/CharacterData" rel="internal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/CharacterData">CharacterData</a> (which inherits from <a title="en/DOM/Node" rel="internal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Node">Node</a>).</p><br><br>
